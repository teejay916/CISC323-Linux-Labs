I used SSH to securely connect to the Sacramento City College server.
`ssh -l cisc32x_wID cis.scc.losrios.edu`


Project 1-3: Using the date command
This project demonstrates that Linux is case-sensitive. The `date` command works, but `Date` does not.
Command:
`date`
`Date`
`date -u`


Project 1-5: Using the 'who' Command
I used the `who` command with various options (`-H`, `-u`, `-q`) to list logged-in users and session details. I also used `who am i` to verify my specific connection.
Command:
`who`, `who -H`, `who -uH`, `who -q`, `who am i`, `whoami`


Project 1-6: Clearing the Terminal
I used the `clear` command to reset the terminal display. This is a vital practice for maintaining a clean and organized workspace during complex tasks.
Command:
 `clear`


Project 1-7: Accessing Manual Pages
I used the `man` command to access the system's built-in manual for the `who` command. This is an essential skill for troubleshooting and learning new command flags.

Commmand:
`man who`
