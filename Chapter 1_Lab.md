Project 1-2: Connecting to the Server
I used SSH to securely connect to the Sacramento City College server.
`ssh -l cisc32x_wID cis.scc.losrios.edu`

Project 1-3: Using the date command
This project demonstrates that Linux is case-sensitive. The `date` command works, but `Date` does not.
Command:
`date`
`Date`
`date -u`

Project 1-5: Using the 'who' Command
I used the `who` command with various options (`-H`, `-u`, `-q`) to list logged-in users and session details. I also used `who am i` to verify my specific connection.

Command:
`who`, `who -H`, `who -uH`, `who -q`, `who am i`, `whoami`
